application. By tracking hand gestures and movements using OpenCV, the project enables users to adjust the volume levels
by simple hand motions.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition for volume control.
- Real-time monitoring of hand movements.
- User-friendly interface for adjusting volume.
- Customizable gesture-to-volume mapping.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **VolumeControlWithCV2** project, follow these steps:

### Requirements

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV library
- Audio output device (speakers or headphones)
